X9g3sN6TA1I-00_07_33.076-00_07_58.019.mp4,the adl said the overwhelming usage of the okay hand gesture today is still its traditional purpose as a gesture of approval so if there 's someone using the symbol they can not be assumed as trying to troll or showing support for white supremacy,00:07:33.076,00:07:58.019
X9g3sN6TA1I-00_07_18.937-00_07_33.076.mp4,there were enough instances of people using the okay gesture in a hateful way that prompted the adl to add it to their database,00:07:18.937,00:07:33.076

X9g3sN6TA1I-00_05_25.615-00_05_57.564.mp4,but after reading the adl 's explanation on the gesture it 's clear that they acknowledge that the gesture is an important part of asl as well as hindu and buddhist worlds and yoga,00:05:25.615,00:05:57.564
X9g3sN6TA1I-00_04_51.415-00_05_10.100.mp4,naturally there was a reaction from some in the deaf community who felt like this was something that threatened our asl signs that have either the f or the 9 handshapes,00:04:51.415,00:05:10.100

G3zfes_ZL5U-00_01_49.543-00_02_09.096.mp4,there was an all female spacewalk scheduled in march but it was dropped because nasa did not have two of the size of spacesuits medium that fit both of them,00:01:49.543,00:02:09.096

G3zfes_ZL5U-00_01_31.290-00_01_34.861.mp4,they were wearing spacesuits and floating outside,00:01:31.290,00:01:34.861

G3zfes_ZL5U-00_00_16.048-00_00_25.591.mp4,this week has been good it 's a big change obviously to come from austin to detroit but it 's going smoothly,00:00:16.048,00:00:25.591
WMoeSSvCyTU-00_02_30.449-00_02_34.454.mp4,he saw a red light and made a right turn while others were marching,00:02:30.449,00:02:34.454
WMoeSSvCyTU-00_02_25.412-00_02_30.449.mp4,if i saw the same thing i would drive slowly or not go at all,00:02:25.412,00:02:30.449
WMoeSSvCyTU-00_02_24.176-00_02_25.412.mp4,he did it on purpose,00:02:24.176,00:02:25.412
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_04_10.740-00_04_12.562.mp4,so an asl first approach solves a lot of problems,00:04:10.740,00:04:12.562
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_04_06.900-00_04_10.740.mp4,the student would see that a class teaches in asl talk about difficulty seeing and get asl tactile,00:04:06.900,00:04:10.740
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_04_01.479-00_04_06.900.mp4,another example is a deafblind student s he might need tactile asl,00:04:01.479,00:04:06.900
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_03_58.280-00_04_01.479.mp4,so an oral student would go from asl to an interpreter and then to captioning,00:03:58.280,00:04:01.479
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_03_53.159-00_03_58.280.mp4,so the student might need voice interpreting and if that 's not enough to have captions as well,00:03:53.159,00:03:58.280
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_03_47.300-00_03_53.159.mp4,an example of this is an oral student goes in a class and needs accessibility because the teacher uses asl,00:03:47.300,00:03:53.159
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_03_27.719-00_03_47.300.mp4,in the can letter it recommended a simple solution to all the communication problems make asl the primary language of instruction in ntid classrooms because with asl the norm accommodations can flow from asl as the cornerstone,00:03:27.719,00:03:47.300
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_01_59.480-00_02_15.099.mp4,"the letter is four pages long and is detailed on issues surrounding meeting the communication needs the letter includes four demands and requires a written response from them by friday, february 5",00:01:59.480,00:02:15.099
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_01_39.959-00_01_59.480.mp4,can wrote a letter on december 7 to dr. stephen aldersley ntid associate vp for academic affairs and cc ed it to ntid president dr. gerald buckley and the rit president,00:01:39.959,00:01:59.480
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_04_12.562-00_04_13.620.mp4,that 's can 's recommendation,00:04:12.562,00:04:13.620
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_01_30.760-00_01_39.719.mp4,a week after that third forum a student organization communication access now was formed,00:01:30.760,00:01:39.719
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_01_12.680-00_01_18.680.mp4,it seems like the third forum with administrators did not go well in respect to students having their needs met,00:01:12.680,00:01:18.680
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_01_07.760-00_01_12.079.mp4,the third forum included administrators and their responses,00:01:07.760,00:01:12.079
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_00_56.240-00_01_07.760.mp4,the ensuing discussion led to a petition and this led to three communication forums with students faculty and the administration it seems came together to those forums,00:00:56.240,00:01:07.760
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_00_53.240-00_00_56.240.mp4,oral students say they do not have access,00:00:53.240,00:00:56.240
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_00_38.219-00_00_53.219.mp4,this movement was started by oral students when on september 1 they came to a ntid student assembly and brought up their frustration with lack of accessibility in the classrooms,00:00:38.219,00:00:53.219
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_00_32.740-00_00_38.020.mp4,an unlikely group of students started this wave of student demands,00:00:32.740,00:00:38.020
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_00_25.940-00_00_32.740.mp4,we will talk first about communication accessibility and then we ll get to the students of color s issues,00:00:25.940,00:00:32.740
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_00_07.400-00_00_13.560.mp4,there are now two major separate issues brought up by the students at ntid/rit,00:00:07.400,00:00:13.560
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_00_04.099-00_00_07.400.mp4,today s show will be all about ntid/rit,00:00:04.099,00:00:07.400
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_01_18.680-00_01_30.280.mp4,one individual let me know that at the forum administrators did not take student concerns seriously and even clapped each other s hands after they gave responses to student concerns,00:01:18.680,00:01:30.280
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_00_00.400-00_00_04.040.mp4,hello welcome to the daily moth,00:00:00.400,00:00:04.040
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_04_13.620-00_04_14.699.mp4,now here 's a interesting twist,00:04:13.620,00:04:14.699
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_04_27.319-00_04_34.060.mp4,it does n't seem to be ntid 's norm to provide interpreters for instructors who only use asl,00:04:27.319,00:04:34.060
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_07_23.779-00_07_24.759.mp4,you can see it at the link above,00:07:23.779,00:07:24.759
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_07_11.180-00_07_23.779.mp4,the letter stated that dr. buckley told the ebony club that they could let him know what he can do what he can do to help them so the ebony club wrote their concerns in this two page letter,00:07:11.180,00:07:23.779
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_06_59.259-00_07_11.180.mp4,they wrote a letter to dr. gerald buckley thanking him for attending a blacklivesmatter event on november 14 he met them for lunch,00:06:59.259,00:07:11.180
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_06_49.920-00_06_55.057.mp4,the purpose of ebony club is to give leadership and a home for black students,00:06:49.920,00:06:55.057
yH_kzYMc0dE-00_06_17.500-00_06_31.040.mp4,for ntid students in the classroom deaf hard of hearing or oral students with different backgrounds for them to come together and if they want accessibility to each other and with the teacher ntid is n't really meeting that need through the fdi process,00:06:17.500,00:06:31.040

ALW91e6WPTU-00_04_53.593-00_04_57.596.mp4,i want to emphasize that black asl is not the same everywhere,00:04:53.593,00:04:57.596
ALW91e6WPTU-00_04_50.322-00_04_53.593.mp4,so that is an example of black asl,00:04:50.322,00:04:53.593
ALW91e6WPTU-00_04_44.785-00_04_50.322.mp4,for example shows signs for my bad tight and tripping,00:04:44.785,00:04:50.322

ALW91e6WPTU-00_04_41.548-00_04_44.785.mp4,there are certain vocabulary words that influences how they sign,00:04:41.548,00:04:44.785
ALW91e6WPTU-00_04_33.540-00_04_37.476.mp4,but younger black deaf people still have their own variation as well,00:04:33.540,00:04:37.476
ALW91e6WPTU-00_04_28.935-00_04_33.540.mp4,now those signs are fading away because they are not passed forward to young people,00:04:28.935,00:04:33.540

ALW91e6WPTU-00_07_59.913-00_08_13.192.mp4,dr. hill said he hopes that there will be young people who feel inspired to continue his work in researching black asl,00:07:59.913,00:08:13.192
ALW91e6WPTU-00_05_23.889-00_05_29.428.mp4,for each state i visited i did research on two different groups,00:05:23.889,00:05:29.428
ALW91e6WPTU-00_05_32.766-00_05_43.944.mp4,we collected data before 2007 up to 2010 in that range so they were 55 years and above at that time,00:05:32.766,00:05:43.944
ALW91e6WPTU-00_07_34.153-00_07_37.290.mp4,thank you dr. hill for your time,00:07:34.153,00:07:37.290
ALW91e6WPTU-00_07_24.110-00_07_31.718.mp4,we really need to include more diversity so we can show we are diverse in different ways,00:07:24.110,00:07:31.718
ALW91e6WPTU-00_07_14.968-00_07_24.110.mp4,so we have to think hard on how we can elevate all deaf people to be involved because deaf people are not just deaf people are people,00:07:14.968,00:07:24.110
ALW91e6WPTU-00_07_00.687-00_07_14.968.mp4,so for all of us it should n't just be me doing the work it requirers all of us to create those opportunities to increase diversity in our literature our schools our businesses and other areas,00:07:00.687,00:07:14.968
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_55.581-00_07_00.687.mp4,asian lgbt and many others,00:06:55.581,00:07:00.687
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_51.377-00_06_55.581.mp4,but there are other communities that also has needs,00:06:51.377,00:06:55.581
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_48.574-00_06_51.377.mp4,that 's my calling for the black deaf community,00:06:48.574,00:06:51.377
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_39.499-00_06_48.574.mp4,it means you have to produce materials then figure out a way to publish it and disseminate it so others can have more,00:06:39.499,00:06:48.574
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_33.892-00_06_39.499.mp4,who has the ability the network the resources,00:06:33.892,00:06:39.499
ALW91e6WPTU-00_05_29.428-00_05_32.766.mp4,the first is an older group which is those who are 55 years old and above,00:05:29.428,00:05:32.766
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_31.024-00_06_33.892.mp4,but how do we get there,00:06:31.024,00:06:33.892
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_26.586-00_06_29.389.mp4,i feel there needs to be a lot more diversity in materials,00:06:26.586,00:06:29.389
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_22.214-00_06_26.586.mp4,there is no or very little mention of cultures images or videos,00:06:22.214,00:06:26.586
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_10.103-00_06_22.214.mp4,for me it is frustrating to see deaf studies or asl classes or interpreting classes their course material is often not diverse,00:06:10.103,00:06:22.214
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_08.634-00_06_10.103.mp4,not many,00:06:08.634,00:06:10.103
ALW91e6WPTU-00_05_58.324-00_06_08.634.mp4,for me i feel as a socio linguist i feel it is my duty to do research and find information about black and deaf people because who does that work,00:05:58.324,00:06:08.634
ALW91e6WPTU-00_05_54.454-00_05_58.324.mp4,so their educational experiences are different which could affect their language use,00:05:54.454,00:05:58.324
ALW91e6WPTU-00_05_49.983-00_05_54.454.mp4,while with those who are younger those under 35 years old they were in an integrated environment,00:05:49.983,00:05:54.454
ALW91e6WPTU-00_05_46.612-00_05_49.983.mp4,they were often segregated,00:05:46.612,00:05:49.983
ALW91e6WPTU-00_05_43.944-00_05_46.612.mp4,so it means their educational experiences were different,00:05:43.944,00:05:46.612
ALW91e6WPTU-00_06_29.389-00_06_31.024.mp4,this is critical,00:06:29.389,00:06:31.024

RygecVXnBB0-00_20_35.800-00_20_51.650.mp4,fortunately none of the interactions with police officers resulted in arrests or harm towards deaf customers but one has to wonder what could happen if there was a miscommunication or a misunderstanding,00:20:35.800,00:20:51.650

mjtuNwD-CcU-00_03_46.626-00_03_55.735.mp4,they hope the uk government has a plan or a policy ready for social care workers who are not uk legal residents,00:03:46.626,00:03:55.735
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_04_51.290-00_04_53.759.mp4,they have been working on the accessibility law for some years,00:04:51.290,00:04:53.759
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_09_32.371-00_09_35.341.mp4,there is no legislation here protecting bsl as a language,00:09:32.371,00:09:35.341
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_06_16.108-00_06_46.639.mp4,well every member state of the eu have their own deaf disability rights laws it differs between member states but the ultimate authority is the un no i mean the eu the european union however we have the un ... let me see uncrpd that is the top ... every country has their own versions yet they have to follow the uncrpd for deaf disability legislations amp protection,00:06:16.108,00:06:46.639
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_06_59.519-00_07_00.887.mp4,not for us in great britain,00:06:59.519,00:07:00.887
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_09_26.932-00_09_29.535.mp4,i really hope our rights will be preserved protected,00:09:26.932,00:09:29.535
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_09_22.861-00_09_26.932.mp4,to be exact i do n't know what will happen after brexit actually i do n't know,00:09:22.861,00:09:26.932
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_09_14.921-00_09_22.861.mp4,however uncrpd will continue advising warning everyone that we have broken the laws raising the issues everywhere,00:09:14.921,00:09:22.861
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_09_05.644-00_09_14.921.mp4,so as for brexit i do n't know if the legislation for deaf disability rights will be changed or left in the same place that i do n't know,00:09:05.644,00:09:14.921
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_08_59.605-00_09_05.644.mp4,it seems to be a common problem among other countries too no real strictness there,00:08:59.605,00:09:05.644
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_08_54.200-00_08_59.605.mp4,there is no real enforcement to make sure uk has to follow the laws,00:08:54.200,00:08:59.605
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_08_38.083-00_08_54.200.mp4,there is a... 2 years ago in geneva switzerland uncrpd made an announcement that britain have broken many deaf disability laws however they have done nothing about that,00:08:38.083,00:08:54.200
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_08_34.047-00_08_38.083.mp4,if we leave the eu it means we will ignore the directives and do our own laws making and amending them our way,00:08:34.047,00:08:38.083
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_08_26.706-00_08_34.047.mp4,as of now eu laws directives have priority over uk laws here yes above us for this we have to follow the eu,00:08:26.706,00:08:34.047
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_06_46.639-00_06_59.519.mp4,for example with lithuania they have a national state funded public interpreting service and they can get video interpreting service for free accessible anytime with no limits,00:06:46.639,00:06:59.519
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_08_10.089-00_08_15.762.mp4,in a nutshell if they do that we can access all public services,00:08:10.089,00:08:15.762
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_07_47.934-00_08_05.017.mp4,besides the video interpreting services here is not state funded it has to come out of our pockets or companies businesses will pay for this for which we can use free of charge but it has to be relevant to their own services if we want to use vis for something not relevant we have to pay for it,00:07:47.934,00:08:05.017
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_07_40.060-00_07_47.934.mp4,however there is an emergency interpreting service provision but we would have to wait forever until one turns up that 's the time consumed looking for someone available you see,00:07:40.060,00:07:47.934
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_07_35.954-00_07_40.060.mp4,we ca n't just book the interpreter for tomorrow or the day after that is impossible,00:07:35.954,00:07:40.060
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_07_24.810-00_07_35.954.mp4,right now we have over 900 registered qualified interpreters however that causes problems for us because when we try to book one when seeing a doctor it has to be done a week or two in advance,00:07:24.810,00:07:35.954
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_07_13.733-00_07_24.810.mp4,is it easy to get bsl interpreters and make relay text and video calls,00:07:13.733,00:07:24.810
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_07_12.831-00_07_13.733.mp4,yeah that 's it,00:07:12.831,00:07:13.733
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_07_11.531-00_07_12.831.mp4,not all are the same but there are some similarities,00:07:11.531,00:07:12.831
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_07_06.725-00_07_11.531.mp4,you see there is variety in national laws across europe they are not the same,00:07:06.725,00:07:11.531
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_07_00.887-00_07_06.725.mp4,we have to rely on agencies for that and their video interpreting services are not funded by the state,00:07:00.887,00:07:06.725
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_08_05.017-00_08_10.089.mp4,that is why we are campaigning the government state to pay for such services as it will benefit the deaf community,00:08:05.017,00:08:10.089
mjtuNwD-CcU-00_03_44.657-00_03_46.626.mp4,the concern is very telling,00:03:44.657,00:03:46.626

n5524md29E8-00_12_10.730-00_12_16.869.mp4,before during and after the trial they often give up after sufficient evidence is found,00:12:10.730,00:12:16.869
n5524md29E8-00_11_51.311-00_12_10.730.mp4,either it is up to or during the trial they can plead guilty often because they see all the evidence that the prosecution has brought up in trial as well as witnesses detectives police officers and others,00:11:51.311,00:12:10.730
n5524md29E8-00_11_42.701-00_11_51.311.mp4,however i 'm not knowledgeable about california 's rules but you can change your plea,00:11:42.701,00:11:51.311
n5524md29E8-00_11_40.399-00_11_42.701.mp4,there are no deadlines for this,00:11:40.399,00:11:42.701
n5524md29E8-00_11_35.961-00_11_40.399.mp4,when 's the deadline before mavrick is unable to do so,00:11:35.961,00:11:40.399
n5524md29E8-00_11_34.826-00_11_35.961.mp4,yes,00:11:34.826,00:11:35.961
n5524md29E8-00_11_29.755-00_11_34.826.mp4,can mavrick and his defense team change their plea,00:11:29.755,00:11:34.826
n5524md29E8-00_12_22.375-00_12_27.312.mp4,the prosecution will bring it up that there was an attempt to flee,00:12:22.375,00:12:27.312
n5524md29E8-00_11_05.230-00_11_27.754.mp4,here with this murder case i think if he pleads not guilty and is not willing to change his plea then the prosecution will have to pursue harsher maximum amount of penalty possible,00:11:05.230,00:11:27.754
n5524md29E8-00_10_42.708-00_10_57.923.mp4,like in a sexual assault case forcing a young victim who is a minor to endure the strains of trial can be very traumatic for this child,00:10:42.708,00:10:57.923
n5524md29E8-00_10_27.693-00_10_42.708.mp4,maybe the prosecution will persuade the defense to negotiate in order to save money to save time to save them the trouble of bringing in witnesses,00:10:27.693,00:10:42.708
n5524md29E8-00_10_21.421-00_10_27.693.mp4,so it 's a lot of work for both the prosecution and defendant to prepare,00:10:21.421,00:10:27.693
n5524md29E8-00_10_16.950-00_10_21.421.mp4,i do n't know if that will happen but it is possible though,00:10:16.950,00:10:21.421
n5524md29E8-00_10_08.875-00_10_16.950.mp4,the trial might move to dismiss the charges based on lack of evidence,00:10:08.875,00:10:16.950
n5524md29E8-00_10_01.634-00_10_08.875.mp4,the prosecution must prepare for these kinds of motions,00:10:01.634,00:10:08.875
n5524md29E8-00_09_48.955-00_10_01.634.mp4,the defense might make a motion to eliminate certain eyewitnesses,00:09:48.955,00:10:01.634
n5524md29E8-00_09_36.576-00_09_44.616.mp4,maybe they can produce the rock that killed grant the deaf victim,00:09:36.576,00:09:44.616
n5524md29E8-00_09_34.706-00_09_36.576.mp4,they 'll bring up circumstantial evidence as well,00:09:34.706,00:09:36.576
n5524md29E8-00_10_57.923-00_11_05.230.mp4,this creates more pressure to negotiate a plea to avoid further trauma,00:10:57.923,00:11:05.230
n5524md29E8-00_09_24.730-00_09_34.706.mp4,they could put on police officers on the stand and put on eyewitnesses who saw something before during or after the crime,00:09:24.730,00:09:34.706
n5524md29E8-00_12_27.312-00_12_31.283.mp4,so yes you can change your plea anytime,00:12:27.312,00:12:31.283
n5524md29E8-00_12_41.628-00_12_50.035.mp4,if the negotiations fail that can not be used against the defendant in trial,00:12:41.628,00:12:50.035

n5524md29E8-00_08_54.134-00_09_09.849.mp4,they could interview potential eyewitnesses or canvass the area asking people if they heard anything saw anything on the night of -insert date here-,00:08:54.134,00:09:09.849
n5524md29E8-00_04_34.574-00_04_51.757.mp4,a preliminary hearing is simply an opportunity for the defense to ask perhaps to eliminate or reduce the charges against the client,00:04:34.574,00:04:51.757

n5524md29E8-00_04_23.596-00_04_32.738.mp4,they might ask the court in the preliminary hearing which i understand has been set for october 23,00:04:23.596,00:04:32.738
n5524md29E8-00_04_08.981-00_04_23.596.mp4,that 's going to be hard to throw out that evidence and the other thing is the lawyers will review all the evidence in order to try to knock out certain parts of the evidence,00:04:08.981,00:04:23.596
n5524md29E8-00_03_56.135-00_04_08.981.mp4,they 're making strategic decisions on whether or not they want to proceed to trial or because mavrick has already told others that he has committed these crimes,00:03:56.135,00:04:08.981
n5524md29E8-00_03_47.627-00_03_56.135.mp4,these lawyers are doing a lot of work interviewing the clients and gathering evidence from the prosecutors,00:03:47.627,00:03:56.135
n5524md29E8-00_03_43.789-00_03_47.627.mp4,if you plead guilty then you can negotiate down your sentence,00:03:43.789,00:03:47.627
n5524md29E8-00_03_33.413-00_03_43.789.mp4,then the penalty would be a lot more severe than if he is willing to plead guilty right away or sooner,00:03:33.413,00:03:43.789
n5524md29E8-00_03_27.240-00_03_33.413.mp4,this makes the state have to work harder to find mavrick guilty,00:03:27.240,00:03:33.413
n5524md29E8-00_04_53.959-00_04_58.632.mp4,they might ask for a psychiatric evaluation,00:04:53.959,00:04:58.632
n5524md29E8-00_03_13.627-00_03_27.240.mp4,if he goes on and challenges the state to proceed with the trial with eyewitness testimonies motions and et cetera,00:03:13.627,00:03:27.240
n5524md29E8-00_02_50.503-00_03_08.055.mp4,so the significance is simple that he the defendant is exercising his right to demand that the state proves his guilt beyond reasonable doubt,00:02:50.503,00:03:08.055
n5524md29E8-00_02_45.298-00_02_50.503.mp4,they may be doing this or maybe they 're going to prepare for the trial,00:02:45.298,00:02:50.503
n5524md29E8-00_02_32.451-00_02_45.298.mp4,now having said that it is possible that now the lawyers are intending to negotiate for a guilty plea later on,00:02:32.451,00:02:45.298
n5524md29E8-00_02_22.175-00_02_32.451.mp4,they have the right to say to the state come on try it and prove your case beyond a reasonable doubt,00:02:22.175,00:02:32.451
n5524md29E8-00_02_17.137-00_02_22.175.mp4,it 's their right to do so under our current laws,00:02:17.137,00:02:22.175
n5524md29E8-00_02_00.319-00_02_17.137.mp4,so um the significance of pleading not guilty is simply that the defendant and his attorneys have decided to challenge the prosecutor 's case,00:02:00.319,00:02:17.137
n5524md29E8-00_01_58.584-00_02_00.319.mp4,of course,00:01:58.584,00:02:00.319
n5524md29E8-00_01_53.746-00_01_58.584.mp4,so i do hope that i 'm qualified to answer these questions,00:01:53.746,00:01:58.584
n5524md29E8-00_01_42.602-00_01_53.746.mp4,i was in the appeals bureau so i have developed knowledge of criminal law,00:01:42.602,00:01:53.746

n5524md29E8-00_09_09.849-00_09_17.423.mp4,then they give all the documents from the investigation to the district attorney da,00:09:09.849,00:09:17.423

n5524md29E8-00_05_19.252-00_05_24.658.mp4,it is kind of like a trial before a trial,00:05:19.252,00:05:24.658
n5524md29E8-00_08_42.154-00_08_50.596.mp4,if he was murdered somewhere else then did someone else see what happened before during or after the crime,00:08:42.154,00:08:50.596

n5524md29E8-00_07_44.230-00_07_50.437.mp4,i do not know if that is what will happen here but it is one possibility,00:07:44.230,00:07:50.437
n5524md29E8-00_07_26.245-00_07_42.295.mp4,the prosecution will try to prove this while the defense 's experts will state that they 've examined interviewed and found that he has some kind of a mental disease,00:07:26.245,00:07:42.295
n5524md29E8-00_05_11.211-00_05_19.252.mp4,they feel they ca n't get a fair trial so they might ask for the trial proceedings to be moved to another county,00:05:11.211,00:05:19.252
n5524md29E8-00_07_18.404-00_07_26.245.mp4,they will say that you can not excuse his behavior based on his knowledge of what is right and wrong,00:07:18.404,00:07:26.245
n5524md29E8-00_06_44.103-00_07_00.252.mp4,maybe there 's some evidence that mavrick freaked out or he suffered some kind of a mental disease,00:06:44.103,00:07:00.252
n5524md29E8-00_06_31.024-00_06_44.103.mp4,i mean that they might plead not guilty by reason of insanity,00:06:31.024,00:06:44.103
n5524md29E8-00_06_29.088-00_06_31.024.mp4,what did you mean,00:06:29.088,00:06:31.024

BXjgMNlzXts-00_05_56.519-00_06_03.480.mp4,back then deaf and hard of hearing patients would have to stick with their local doctors who might not communicate well,00:05:56.519,00:06:03.480

_2cg2YLx6mg-00_11_13.706-00_11_23.249.mp4,about a year ago i got into a partnership with dpan to provide captions on the daily moth videos,00:11:13.706,00:11:23.249

EslZp7UiTck-00_09_54.494-00_10_07.807.mp4,we need board members who will take a strong stance to support the university including establishing expectations for the president and the leadership team,00:09:54.494,00:10:07.807
cvqbe6xyT7Y-00_07_03.189-00_07_08.093.mp4,hollander is himself dead of an apparent suicide,00:07:03.189,00:07:08.093
cvqbe6xyT7Y-00_07_25.144-00_07_39.959.mp4,he was involved with a legal case that was taken up by judge salas - but that case did n't go into his favor,00:07:25.144,00:07:39.959
EslZp7UiTck-00_06_54.514-00_07_06.892.mp4,there was also internal and external pressure as the community can see from vlogs and posts for greg hlibok to also step down from his role on the executive committee,00:06:54.514,00:07:06.892
EslZp7UiTck-00_06_34.226-00_06_54.514.mp4,i understand that there was internal pressure for seth bravin who was as of two days ago the chair there was internal and external pressure because of the kappa gamma situation for him to step down from that position,00:06:34.226,00:06:54.514
EslZp7UiTck-00_06_28.887-00_06_32.091.mp4,he respectfully declined,00:06:28.887,00:06:32.091
EslZp7UiTck-00_06_23.283-00_06_28.887.mp4,i understand that people tried to sway him to become the chair of the board but it did n't work,00:06:23.283,00:06:28.887
EslZp7UiTck-00_06_14.774-00_06_23.283.mp4,also behind the scenes i know that they tried to bring in a former trustee duane halliburton,00:06:14.774,00:06:23.283
EslZp7UiTck-00_06_12.939-00_06_14.774.mp4,that is a mystery,00:06:12.939,00:06:14.774
EslZp7UiTck-00_06_03.829-00_06_12.939.mp4,as a consultant as an advisor but instead as a chair,00:06:03.829,00:06:12.939
EslZp7UiTck-00_06_00.192-00_06_03.829.mp4,he would be perfect in that role,00:06:00.192,00:06:03.829
EslZp7UiTck-00_05_51.250-00_06_00.192.mp4,the meeting of minds building trust and unity and building understanding,00:05:51.250,00:06:00.192
EslZp7UiTck-00_07_06.892-00_07_14.934.mp4,there was also threats against additional board members to step down if the aforementioned two did not relinquish their leadership roles,00:07:06.892,00:07:14.934
EslZp7UiTck-00_05_43.009-00_05_51.250.mp4,hire him as a mediator between the university and the community to facilitate dialogue,00:05:43.009,00:05:51.250
EslZp7UiTck-00_05_32.732-00_05_41.107.mp4,if the university recognizes his worth they should hire him,00:05:32.732,00:05:41.107
EslZp7UiTck-00_05_28.461-00_05_32.732.mp4,i believe that he is worth so much more,00:05:28.461,00:05:32.732
EslZp7UiTck-00_05_19.752-00_05_28.461.mp4,i support dr. anderson who still has my deep love and honor,00:05:19.752,00:05:28.461
EslZp7UiTck-00_05_11.444-00_05_19.752.mp4,i have worked to hard to promote unity so i will choose my words carefully,00:05:11.444,00:05:19.752
EslZp7UiTck-00_05_00.132-00_05_11.444.mp4,there is a semblance that division is behind some of the decisions that we have seen come out of the university,00:05:00.132,00:05:11.444
EslZp7UiTck-00_04_49.288-00_05_00.132.mp4,i will choose my words carefully because i am not going to play in the hands of those who seek to divide and conquer our community,00:04:49.288,00:05:00.132
EslZp7UiTck-00_04_42.014-00_04_49.288.mp4,myself as the most recent person who resigned found that he ...,00:04:42.014,00:04:49.288
EslZp7UiTck-00_04_29.870-00_04_42.014.mp4,especially at this time in our community someone of his stature is worthy to be called to serve but as the board chair,00:04:29.870,00:04:42.014
EslZp7UiTck-00_04_03.443-00_04_29.870.mp4,the president isidore has already explained that he is capable but at the same time what is mysterious about that appointment as chair is that of many ways that the university could have tapped in his who he is what he brings to the table there are many other ways they could use him,00:04:03.443,00:04:29.870
EslZp7UiTck-00_05_41.107-00_05_43.009.mp4,as a consultant,00:05:41.107,00:05:43.009
EslZp7UiTck-00_03_47.894-00_04_03.443.mp4,at the same time i think the announcement of his appointment sent shockwaves throughout the community with him being selected as chair,00:03:47.894,00:04:03.443
EslZp7UiTck-00_07_14.934-00_07_27.646.mp4,so i unfortunately in my view dr. anderson is a resolution to keep the two on the board and at the same time resolve the issue of having a chair,00:07:14.934,00:07:27.646
EslZp7UiTck-00_07_41.728-00_07_43.495.mp4,so i wish him the best,00:07:41.728,00:07:43.495
EslZp7UiTck-00_09_37.876-00_09_45.051.mp4,right now it seems like it 's the other way around with the president controlling the board,00:09:37.876,00:09:45.051
EslZp7UiTck-00_09_19.525-00_09_37.876.mp4,we have finalized a follow up letter to the board of trustees to ask them to show us where the line is between the board 's responsibility to oversee the university president and staff organizations,00:09:19.525,00:09:37.876
EslZp7UiTck-00_08_50.129-00_09_19.525.mp4,what we know per our previous request that gallaudet university as the center of global deaf success as a reflection of deaf schools that look to it as a model of education leadership and academics we have not seen any action since our letter,00:08:50.129,00:09:19.525
EslZp7UiTck-00_08_45.424-00_08_50.129.mp4,we ca n't say that their decision is wrong or right,00:08:45.424,00:08:50.129
EslZp7UiTck-00_08_37.649-00_08_45.424.mp4,our goal is to continue the dialogue with the board who made the decision,00:08:37.649,00:08:45.424
EslZp7UiTck-00_08_31.877-00_08_37.649.mp4,and ... well i 'll leave it at that,00:08:31.877,00:08:37.649
EslZp7UiTck-00_08_28.341-00_08_31.877.mp4,so i wish dr. anderson the best,00:08:28.341,00:08:31.877
EslZp7UiTck-00_08_25.372-00_08_28.341.mp4,based on recent incidents obviously not,00:08:25.372,00:08:28.341
EslZp7UiTck-00_08_22.334-00_08_25.372.mp4,have we seen changes,00:08:22.334,00:08:25.372
EslZp7UiTck-00_07_27.646-00_07_41.728.mp4,it is an unfortunate way to take advantage of dr. anderson because i know there are many ways they could capitalize on what he offers to the university while at the same time giving him the ability to have his neutrality that would have been available to the community that needs him very much,00:07:27.646,00:07:41.728
EslZp7UiTck-00_08_13.459-00_08_22.334.mp4,many consultants were brought in to plan diversity and inclusion development over the years,00:08:13.459,00:08:22.334

63hltb-VK6Y-00_05_03.136-00_05_23.589.mp4,rosenblum said he suspects that the numbers of applications for social security benefits has skyrocketed and encouraged any deaf person who have lost their jobs and ca n't find another to go ahead and apply for benefits right now so they can support themselves and their families,00:05:03.136,00:05:23.589
63hltb-VK6Y-00_04_33.906-00_04_47.319.mp4,he said the nad is talking with tech companies to ask for changes and to develop policy guidelines for office based jobs,00:04:33.906,00:04:47.319
63hltb-VK6Y-00_04_11.450-00_04_33.906.mp4,he said online video meeting platforms such as zoom tends to highlight people based on who is speaking audio and that if there is an interpreter it was difficult or impossible for the deaf person to pin the person or enlarge their screen,00:04:11.450,00:04:33.906
63hltb-VK6Y-00_01_18.111-00_01_31.457.mp4,he said there are issues with interpreting at hospitals because they do not have ppe equipment masks gloves gowns,00:01:18.111,00:01:31.457
63hltb-VK6Y-00_03_48.527-00_04_11.450.mp4,rosenblum said he notices that deaf people who have office based jobs still have their jobs but face barriers because they no longer have access to in person interpreters or cart captioning that they had before for their meetings,00:03:48.527,00:04:11.450
63hltb-VK6Y-00_03_25.572-00_03_32.479.mp4,she said the actual numbers were likely to be much higher because not everyone can report the they lost their jobs,00:03:25.572,00:03:32.479
63hltb-VK6Y-00_03_12.758-00_03_25.572.mp4,dr. rashid said the coronavirus crisis has hit the u.s. economy like a bomb with over 22 million americans losing their jobs,00:03:12.758,00:03:25.572
63hltb-VK6Y-00_03_02.115-00_03_12.758.mp4,she said it was an overnight change that students had to go home from an environment rich in asl and sign language to a remote setting,00:03:02.115,00:03:12.758
63hltb-VK6Y-00_02_52.572-00_03_02.115.mp4,she said gallaudet is still adapting to the challenge of being remote but that students are still working towards their degrees,00:02:52.572,00:03:02.115
63hltb-VK6Y-00_02_43.663-00_02_52.572.mp4,cordano said she was proud of the deaf ecosystem for providing resources to support each other,00:02:43.663,00:02:52.572
63hltb-VK6Y-00_02_34.987-00_02_43.663.mp4,csd is also providing grants to organizations affected by covid-19,00:02:34.987,00:02:43.663
63hltb-VK6Y-00_02_07.593-00_02_34.987.mp4,soukup said csd is working with other organizations to provide accessibility to white house press briefings and that csd has established an asl coronavirus hotline with deaf agents available to provide support to the community if they have questions or concerns,00:02:07.593,00:02:34.987
63hltb-VK6Y-00_01_51.844-00_02_07.593.mp4,rosenblum also said he was concerned about access to interpreters for deaf children who are in mainstream k-12 programs or postsecondary programs as they shift to remote classes,00:01:51.844,00:02:07.593
63hltb-VK6Y-00_01_42.368-00_01_51.844.mp4,he is also working on telehealth policy guidelines,00:01:42.368,00:01:51.844
63hltb-VK6Y-00_03_32.479-00_03_48.527.mp4,she said the impact on the deaf population was likely different and wondered what the numbers were for deaf people because many already do n't have jobs or work part time while collecting social security benefits,00:03:32.479,00:03:48.527
63hltb-VK6Y-00_06_53.680-00_07_02.622.mp4,she said after covid-19 some companies will not survive while others will thrive,00:06:53.680,00:07:02.622

LCLTOtMc-5Q-00_00_37.320-00_00_40.259.mp4,i think we really did figure that out this whole week,00:00:37.320,00:00:40.259
zj71SOX9oCo-00_23_14.125-00_23_19.540.mp4,microsoft has provided this access for several years now,00:23:14.125,00:23:19.540
zj71SOX9oCo-00_23_10.165-00_23_14.125.mp4,microsoft is separate from connect direct,00:23:10.165,00:23:14.125
zj71SOX9oCo-00_23_03.083-00_23_10.165.mp4,we also learned that microsoft provides services in asl too,00:23:03.083,00:23:10.165
zj71SOX9oCo-00_22_57.040-00_23_03.083.mp4,the link to connect direct's website is in the transcript below,00:22:57.040,00:23:03.083
zj71SOX9oCo-00_22_54.040-00_22_57.040.mp4,thank you radford for your time,00:22:54.040,00:22:57.040
zj71SOX9oCo-00_22_49.458-00_22_54.040.mp4,radford mentioned that nothing beats direct communication,00:22:49.458,00:22:54.040
zj71SOX9oCo-00_22_44.750-00_22_49.458.mp4,oh yeah i 'd encourage you to utilize this feature as much as you can,00:22:44.750,00:22:49.458

zj71SOX9oCo-00_22_32.290-00_22_42.665.mp4,so you can look into the products that they offer and benefit from our direct support services whenever you have questions or have issues that you need to solve,00:22:32.290,00:22:42.665
zj71SOX9oCo-00_23_19.540-00_23_33.958.mp4,i personally have gone in all three sites google comcast and microsoft and checked to make sure the asl support option worked,00:23:19.540,00:23:33.958
zj71SOX9oCo-00_22_22.208-00_22_32.290.mp4,secondly with google i would research what sort of products they have like the nest which is a home security device that is owned by google,00:22:22.208,00:22:32.290
zj71SOX9oCo-00_22_09.333-00_22_14.000.mp4,we are not trying to support comcast by directing customers to them,00:22:09.333,00:22:14.000
zj71SOX9oCo-00_22_01.415-00_22_09.333.mp4,if you have comcast services available in your area you should consider switching to comcast,00:22:01.415,00:22:09.333
zj71SOX9oCo-00_21_55.750-00_22_01.415.mp4,typically you 'd call these companies through vrs but not anymore because you can connect with them directly via videoconferencing in sign language,00:21:55.750,00:22:01.415
zj71SOX9oCo-00_21_45.708-00_21_55.750.mp4,i would if you were a current comcast customer and if you needed tech support or you might have questions with the billing,00:21:45.708,00:21:55.750
zj71SOX9oCo-00_21_41.625-00_21_45.708.mp4,how can the deaf community show our support,00:21:41.625,00:21:45.708
zj71SOX9oCo-00_21_37.958-00_21_41.625.mp4,so i think it 's important that the deaf community is behind this,00:21:37.958,00:21:41.625
zj71SOX9oCo-00_21_29.790-00_21_37.958.mp4,there will be companies who will recognize the value in providing these services and they will continue these practices,00:21:29.790,00:21:37.958
zj71SOX9oCo-00_21_22.250-00_21_29.790.mp4,because if they use it it can be used as evidence that the deaf and hard of hearing customers prefer direct sign language communication,00:21:22.250,00:21:29.790
zj71SOX9oCo-00_21_14.958-00_21_22.250.mp4,i think it 's important that the deaf community knows that it 's available and that they can use it,00:21:14.958,00:21:22.250
zj71SOX9oCo-00_22_14.000-00_22_22.208.mp4,no we are encouraging to consider taking a look at them because they are providing support to our community,00:22:14.000,00:22:22.208

045-gE1O_hQ-00_15_46.403-00_15_51.075.mp4,he should have that conversation with mavrick,00:15:46.403,00:15:51.075
045-gE1O_hQ-00_15_30.428-00_15_42.567.mp4,it is the defense attorney 's job to ask mavrick if he is able to understand and follow the interpreters,00:15:30.428,00:15:42.567
045-gE1O_hQ-00_15_24.048-00_15_30.428.mp4,you have to let the court know right away that it 's not working,00:15:24.048,00:15:30.428
045-gE1O_hQ-00_15_13.412-00_15_24.048.mp4,but if mavrick did not raise the issue of an effective interpreter until after the trial then it means nothing,00:15:13.412,00:15:24.048
045-gE1O_hQ-00_14_58.188-00_15_13.412.mp4,but the defendant would have to write an affidavit saying that the interpreters were n't effective,00:14:58.188,00:15:13.412
045-gE1O_hQ-00_14_55.394-00_14_58.188.mp4,sure,00:14:55.394,00:14:58.188
045-gE1O_hQ-00_14_52.725-00_14_55.394.mp4,is that a possibility,00:14:52.725,00:14:55.394
045-gE1O_hQ-00_14_46.177-00_14_52.725.mp4,so i wonder if a person can appeal their case based on the quality of interpreters,00:14:46.177,00:14:52.725
045-gE1O_hQ-00_14_41.129-00_14_46.177.mp4,he did n't want the translation process,00:14:41.129,00:14:46.177
045-gE1O_hQ-00_14_30.827-00_14_41.129.mp4,the state provided him with two pairs of interpreters but mavrick declined them and preferred to get information directly from hearing interpreters,00:14:30.827,00:14:41.129
045-gE1O_hQ-00_15_42.567-00_15_46.403.mp4,is the interpreter in the right position,00:15:42.567,00:15:46.403
zj71SOX9oCo-00_00_03.290-00_00_05.958.mp4,hello welcome to the daily moth,00:00:03.290,00:00:05.958
045-gE1O_hQ-00_11_38.114-00_11_41.951.mp4,could the sentence be reduced that much,00:11:38.114,00:11:41.951
045-gE1O_hQ-00_11_26.769-00_11_31.106.mp4,is it possible that on december 22 mavrick will walk,00:11:26.769,00:11:31.106
045-gE1O_hQ-00_06_41.276-00_06_48.408.mp4,you also have to think about the money it is expensive to conduct a trial,00:06:41.276,00:06:48.408
045-gE1O_hQ-00_06_24.843-00_06_41.276.mp4,sometimes you are allowed to interview the jury after the verdict and find out what went wrong why they were unable to convict,00:06:24.843,00:06:41.276
045-gE1O_hQ-00_06_21.255-00_06_24.843.mp4,why,00:06:21.255,00:06:24.843
045-gE1O_hQ-00_06_13.790-00_06_21.255.mp4,are there plausible reasons for the deadlock,00:06:13.790,00:06:21.255
045-gE1O_hQ-00_06_02.069-00_06_13.790.mp4,she has to do an analysis maybe you can call it a cost benefit analysis on whether it 's worth it to go forward,00:06:02.069,00:06:13.790
045-gE1O_hQ-00_05_41.632-00_06_02.069.mp4,well the first question is is there a reason why the jury voted not to convict,00:05:41.632,00:06:02.069
045-gE1O_hQ-00_05_35.502-00_05_41.632.mp4,what must the da consider before she makes the decision,00:05:35.502,00:05:41.632
045-gE1O_hQ-00_05_27.661-00_05_35.502.mp4,now the da has until december 4 to decide if she wants a retrial or not,00:05:27.661,00:05:35.502
045-gE1O_hQ-00_05_05.680-00_05_12.103.mp4,on top of the four years or whatever sentence is given,00:05:05.680,00:05:12.103
045-gE1O_hQ-00_06_57.334-00_07_01.588.mp4,maybe it is too emotionally painful for them,00:06:57.334,00:07:01.588
045-gE1O_hQ-00_04_48.245-00_05_03.845.mp4,if mavrick is found guilty of the other two charges voluntary manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon then prison time is guaranteed to go up,00:04:48.245,00:05:03.845
045-gE1O_hQ-00_04_12.877-00_04_28.894.mp4,now on december 4 if the da decides she wants to retry will the december 22 sentencing still take place or be postponed,00:04:12.877,00:04:28.894
045-gE1O_hQ-00_04_08.789-00_04_12.877.mp4,double jeopardy,00:04:08.789,00:04:12.877
045-gE1O_hQ-00_04_01.699-00_04_08.789.mp4,if it is an acquittal you can not retry because that would be a double jeopardy,00:04:01.699,00:04:08.789
045-gE1O_hQ-00_03_53.108-00_04_01.699.mp4,a deadlock means you can retry,00:03:53.108,00:04:01.699
045-gE1O_hQ-00_03_51.564-00_03_53.108.mp4,right,00:03:51.564,00:03:53.108
045-gE1O_hQ-00_03_49.104-00_03_51.564.mp4,that 's done for never again,00:03:49.104,00:03:51.564
045-gE1O_hQ-00_03_37.258-00_03_49.104.mp4,the first degree premeditated charge was found not guilty so it can not be tried again,00:03:37.258,00:03:49.104
045-gE1O_hQ-00_03_13.693-00_03_37.258.mp4,the court informed the district attorney susan krones that she has until december 4 to decide whether she wants a retrial on the charge of voluntary manslaughter,00:03:13.693,00:03:37.258
045-gE1O_hQ-00_03_03.474-00_03_13.693.mp4,but the basic idea is the same intent versus an unintentional accidental killing of someone else,00:03:03.474,00:03:13.693
045-gE1O_hQ-00_04_28.894-00_04_48.245.mp4,if the da decides on december 4 to go for a retrial on two charges the involuntary manslaughter conviction still stands,00:04:28.894,00:04:48.245
045-gE1O_hQ-00_11_31.106-00_11_38.114.mp4,suppose on december 4 the da decides to not retry the case,00:11:31.106,00:11:38.114
045-gE1O_hQ-00_07_01.588-00_07_09.262.mp4,or are the witnesses from the first trial still available,00:07:01.588,00:07:09.262
045-gE1O_hQ-00_07_12.848-00_07_26.571.mp4,you have to assess the evidence to see if you can identify gaps that you can fill to present a stronger case,00:07:12.848,00:07:26.571
045-gE1O_hQ-00_11_06.124-00_11_26.769.mp4,i did some research that said judges in california might because of coronavirus and prisons being full consider the possibility of reducing the sentence to the point where mavrick could walk with probation,00:11:06.124,00:11:26.769
045-gE1O_hQ-00_11_01.369-00_11_06.124.mp4,he has already served one year and three months in jail so that is time credited,00:11:01.369,00:11:06.124
045-gE1O_hQ-00_11_00.033-00_11_01.369.mp4,four years,00:11:00.033,00:11:01.369
045-gE1O_hQ-00_10_49.816-00_11_00.033.mp4,mavrick 's sentence for involuntary manslaughter what is the maximum sentence,00:10:49.816,00:11:00.033
045-gE1O_hQ-00_10_45.937-00_10_49.816.mp4,there is nothing more democratic than that,00:10:45.937,00:10:49.816
045-gE1O_hQ-00_10_36.677-00_10_45.937.mp4,then a jury of twelve people who are drawn from the community makes the decision,00:10:36.677,00:10:45.937
045-gE1O_hQ-00_10_25.457-00_10_36.677.mp4,so the defense attorney makes sure that the system is working by punching holes in the state 's case,00:10:25.457,00:10:36.677
045-gE1O_hQ-00_10_03.477-00_10_25.457.mp4,they force the state to prove it because to deprive someone of their liberty their freedom to put them in jail that 's significant and one of the most serious responsibilities of the state,00:10:03.477,00:10:25.457
045-gE1O_hQ-00_09_56.346-00_10_03.477.mp4,they are forcing the prosecutor to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt,00:09:56.346,00:10:03.477
045-gE1O_hQ-00_07_09.262-00_07_12.848.mp4,what if they disappear,00:07:09.262,00:07:12.848
045-gE1O_hQ-00_09_44.667-00_09_56.346.mp4,the job of the defense attorney is they are not bad people they are good people because they perform a critical role in our system,00:09:44.667,00:09:56.346
045-gE1O_hQ-00_09_04.418-00_09_15.513.mp4,the prosecutor has the burden of evidence to provide each and every aspect of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,00:09:04.418,00:09:15.513
045-gE1O_hQ-00_08_54.451-00_09_04.418.mp4,the presumption of innocence is critical to our justice system,00:08:54.451,00:09:04.418
045-gE1O_hQ-00_08_41.604-00_08_54.451.mp4,in america our law says that a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty,00:08:41.604,00:08:54.451
045-gE1O_hQ-00_08_28.507-00_08_41.604.mp4,the second trial will reflect their understanding of the opposite side 's strategies and adjust,00:08:28.507,00:08:41.604
045-gE1O_hQ-00_08_26.004-00_08_28.507.mp4,so both learned rom each other,00:08:26.004,00:08:28.507
045-gE1O_hQ-00_08_15.452-00_08_26.004.mp4,it is the same on the defense attorney 's side as they learned what the da 's side was and how they pursued the case,00:08:15.452,00:08:26.004
045-gE1O_hQ-00_07_54.014-00_08_15.452.mp4,the da saw the defense 's arguments heard their arguments and understood what their goals was and how they analyzed the evidence and how they thought about their defense,00:07:54.014,00:08:15.452
045-gE1O_hQ-00_07_41.836-00_07_54.014.mp4,the first trial gave both sides a glimpse of the strategy of the other,00:07:41.836,00:07:54.014
045-gE1O_hQ-00_07_26.571-00_07_41.836.mp4,the defense attorney if the da decides she wants to retry what would the defense attorney 's strategy be how would he respond to that,00:07:26.571,00:07:41.836
045-gE1O_hQ-00_09_38.452-00_09_44.667.mp4,it has to be beyond a reasonable doubt,00:09:38.452,00:09:44.667
zj71SOX9oCo-00_21_00.250-00_21_05.500.mp4,are there more companies that connect direct will contract with,00:21:00.250,00:21:05.500
zj71SOX9oCo-00_00_05.958-00_00_09.138.mp4,"it is wednesday, january 29",00:00:05.958,00:00:09.138
zj71SOX9oCo-00_00_15.708-00_00_51.832.mp4,"the new york times reported that china has confirmed over 6,000 cases of novel coronavirus and that the virus has spread overseas with people who have never visited china falling ill in germany japan taiwan and vietnam",00:00:15.708,00:00:51.832
zj71SOX9oCo-00_17_19.208-00_17_24.250.mp4,we all like direct communication right,00:17:19.208,00:17:24.250

zj71SOX9oCo-00_16_36.957-00_16_45.375.mp4,the results from this caucus will count towards iowa 's 3rd congressional district,00:16:36.957,00:16:45.375
zj71SOX9oCo-00_16_30.916-00_16_36.957.mp4,there will be a deaf leader and interpreters will be provided,00:16:30.916,00:16:36.957
zj71SOX9oCo-00_16_05.625-00_16_30.916.mp4,here is a reminder that deaf people in iowa can participate in an asl satellite caucus in des moines at the center for independent living at 100 e euclid ave suite 104,00:16:05.625,00:16:30.916
zj71SOX9oCo-00_15_48.125-00_16_05.625.mp4,this is not a winner take all election as a candidate will get a proportionate amount of votes based on the results from the precincts,00:15:48.125,00:16:05.625
zj71SOX9oCo-00_15_40.250-00_15_48.125.mp4,there are a total of 41 pledged delegates that are up for grabs,00:15:40.250,00:15:48.125
zj71SOX9oCo-00_15_28.000-00_15_40.250.mp4,"cnn explained that there are 1,678 precinct locations in iowa",00:15:28.000,00:15:40.250
zj71SOX9oCo-00_15_20.916-00_15_28.000.mp4,the candidate 's supporters can walk to choose their second favorite candidate,00:15:20.916,00:15:28.000
zj71SOX9oCo-00_17_24.250-00_17_32.833.mp4,google and comcast now provide technical support services in asl for deaf and hard of hearing people,00:17:24.250,00:17:32.833
zj71SOX9oCo-00_15_02.000-00_15_20.916.mp4,if a certain candidate only attracts a small number of supporters usually if it is less than 15% of the attendees the candidate is not considered viable and is dissolved,00:15:02.000,00:15:20.916
zj71SOX9oCo-00_14_54.082-00_14_58.041.mp4,those who support warren go to that corner,00:14:54.082,00:14:58.041
zj71SOX9oCo-00_14_42.041-00_14_54.082.mp4,for example a caucus room leader might say those who support biden go to that corner,00:14:42.041,00:14:54.082
zj71SOX9oCo-00_14_29.541-00_14_42.041.mp4,people in an iowa caucus vote with their bodies by walking to a certain area in a room for a candidate they support,00:14:29.541,00:14:42.041
zj71SOX9oCo-00_14_17.457-00_14_29.541.mp4,as i explained in a video two weeks ago it is not a normal voting process using voting booths,00:14:17.457,00:14:29.541
zj71SOX9oCo-00_14_07.207-00_14_17.457.mp4,the percentages are important because of how the iowa caucuses process works,00:14:07.207,00:14:17.457
zj71SOX9oCo-00_13_51.125-00_14_07.207.mp4,the new york times reported that biden and klobuchar are discussing the possibility of an alliance so both can have enough support to win delegates,00:13:51.125,00:14:07.207
zj71SOX9oCo-00_13_30.500-00_13_51.125.mp4,this could make an impact on bernie 's numbers because yang does not have viable numbers but does have enough supporters that could help bernie gain a lead over biden,00:13:30.500,00:13:51.125
zj71SOX9oCo-00_13_17.000-00_13_30.500.mp4,andrew yang said he would not be surprised if many of his supporters end up choosing bernie,00:13:17.000,00:13:30.500
zj71SOX9oCo-00_13_14.791-00_13_17.000.mp4,so you see that there are varying numbers,00:13:14.791,00:13:17.000
zj71SOX9oCo-00_14_58.041-00_15_02.000.mp4,and so forth for the other candidates,00:14:58.041,00:15:02.000
zj71SOX9oCo-00_12_58.500-00_13_14.791.mp4,an iowa state university poll had bernie in the lead with 24% followed by warren with 19% pete with 17% and biden with 15%,00:12:58.500,00:13:14.791
zj71SOX9oCo-00_17_32.833-00_17_48.000.mp4,when you go into google and comcast websites and click on support you will see an asl option that will lead you to a specialist who will communicate with you directly in asl,00:17:32.833,00:17:48.000
zj71SOX9oCo-00_18_30.875-00_18_44.333.mp4,the daily moth reached out to craig radford the director of business development and strategy for connect direct and csd for an interview,00:18:30.875,00:18:44.333
zj71SOX9oCo-00_20_47.333-00_20_53.125.mp4,while a deaf person calls via videophone we would introduce ourselves on behalf of google,00:20:47.333,00:20:53.125
zj71SOX9oCo-00_20_42.040-00_20_47.333.mp4,as our representatives learn we work more closely with these companies,00:20:42.040,00:20:47.333
zj71SOX9oCo-00_20_34.625-00_20_42.040.mp4,our representatives typically go through training where they learn about the products and/or services that the company provides and they provide the training also,00:20:34.625,00:20:42.040
zj71SOX9oCo-00_20_25.125-00_20_34.625.mp4,so google hired our company to provide customer support for their deaf and hard of hearing customers,00:20:25.125,00:20:34.625
zj71SOX9oCo-00_20_23.083-00_20_25.125.mp4,we 're like a third party contractor,00:20:23.083,00:20:25.125
zj71SOX9oCo-00_20_14.750-00_20_23.083.mp4,people who call a company like comcast would be connected to representatives from comcast or google located at our center or theirs,00:20:14.750,00:20:23.083

lMW3aVp4fRw-00_04_05.300-00_04_10.979.mp4,the success rate of those elite schools are very high and it 's based on a bilingual education at an asl obsessed schools,00:04:05.300,00:04:10.979
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_01_34.804-00_01_35.680.mp4,no question about it,00:01:34.804,00:01:35.680

fk1C9sC3uuw-00_03_01.548-00_03_06.453.mp4,the acs has many more questions than the u.s. census,00:03:01.548,00:03:06.453
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_02_44.197-00_03_01.548.mp4,this survey is conducted by the u.s. census bureau and it is randomly sent out to 3.5 million homes every year,00:02:44.197,00:03:01.548
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_02_29.149-00_02_44.197.mp4,however there is another questionnaire called the american community survey acs that includes a disability and language question,00:02:29.149,00:02:44.197
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_02_23.710-00_02_29.149.mp4,it also does n't ask about which language you use,00:02:23.710,00:02:29.149
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_03_50.463-00_04_07.247.mp4,the acs asks whether the person speaks a language other than english at home and allows you to write the language,00:03:50.463,00:04:07.247
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_02_14.967-00_02_23.710.mp4,there is no question about whether a person is disabled specifically deaf in the 2020 census,00:02:14.967,00:02:23.710
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_01_34.795-00_01_52.611.mp4,there is no citizenship question and the u.s. census will not ask about your social security number your political affiliations or your bank or credit card numbers,00:01:34.795,00:01:52.611
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_01_06.599-00_01_34.795.mp4,they will ask who lives in the home whether they own or rent it their gender male or female age whether the person is of hispanic latino or spanish origin the person 's race whether a person usually live or stay somewhere else and the relationships between persons who live in a home,00:01:06.599,00:01:34.795

fk1C9sC3uuw-00_00_39.171-00_00_55.222.mp4,the u.s. census bureau created a 10-minute asl video that explains the purpose of the questionnaire and how you can complete it,00:00:39.171,00:00:55.222
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_00_32.732-00_00_39.171.mp4,you can complete your census online if you have n't completed it,00:00:32.732,00:00:39.171
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_00_23.957-00_00_32.732.mp4,you have probably received mail or an in person visit from the u.s. census,00:00:23.957,00:00:32.732
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_00_12.846-00_00_23.957.mp4,"the filing deadline for the 2020 u.s. census is september 30, two weeks from now",00:00:12.846,00:00:23.957
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_00_00.434-00_00_12.846.mp4,this video is to provide basic information about the 2020 u.s. census and the american community survey,00:00:00.434,00:00:12.846
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_01_52.611-00_02_14.967.mp4,the u.s. census is collected every ten years and the information in it guides congressional representation and federal funding,00:01:52.611,00:02:14.967
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_01_34.444-00_01_34.804.mp4,for sure,00:01:34.444,00:01:34.804
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_04_07.247-00_04_14.587.mp4,you can write down asl but it is not clear if it will be counted,00:04:07.247,00:04:14.587
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_04_33.139-00_04_49.055.mp4,the language question is there to ensure there is no discrimination against language minorities when they vote,00:04:33.139,00:04:49.055
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_01_24.340-00_01_26.920.mp4,the deaf community should operate the same way,00:01:24.340,00:01:26.920
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_01_11.200-00_01_24.340.mp4,"let 's look at the nfl or ncaa 's coaching tree"" which is when assistant coaches of very good coaches are hired or stolen away to other schools",00:01:11.200,00:01:24.340
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_01_05.397-00_01_10.319.mp4,there is a plethora of deaf individuals out there who are well qualified to fill those 12 positions,00:01:05.397,00:01:10.319
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_01_04.959-00_01_05.397.mp4,not true,00:01:04.959,00:01:05.397
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_00_58.917-00_01_04.959.mp4,six can go to deaf schools but we 'll give up the other six to an audist person -- to let an audist run the deaf school,00:00:58.917,00:01:04.959
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_00_56.700-00_00_58.917.mp4,you might think there might be only six of them,00:00:56.700,00:00:58.917
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_00_50.299-00_00_56.700.mp4,maybe you 're wondering if there 's enough qualified deaf individuals to fill up the vacancies,00:00:50.299,00:00:56.700
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_00_36.500-00_00_50.280.mp4,if it is a hearing person that 's okay but that person must sign asl very well must have worked in a deaf school must understand deaf culture must believe in bilingual education must love asl must be a proven member of the deaf signing community in that instance a hearing superintendent is okay but for all other considerations a deaf superintendent is the only acceptable choice,00:00:36.500,00:00:50.280
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_00_29.977-00_00_36.500.mp4,here in the u.s. we have many different places where we could be more like canada in demanding a deaf superintendent,00:00:29.977,00:00:36.500
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_04_14.587-00_04_33.139.mp4,on the u.s. census's official website it explains that the acs survey language question is not designed to identify asl users,00:04:14.587,00:04:33.139
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_00_28.678-00_00_29.977.mp4,their demands are strong,00:00:28.678,00:00:29.977
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_00_16.980-00_00_23.699.mp4,twelve schools or sixteen if you count four psb schools are now in need of a superintendent,00:00:16.980,00:00:23.699
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_00_10.039-00_00_16.500.mp4,we 've got twelve deaf schools and a province in canada that needs a new superintendent,00:00:10.039,00:00:16.500

fk1C9sC3uuw-00_06_02.995-00_06_20.146.mp4,for the language question i would still put down asl and hope that there can be changes in the future that will make it possible to count how many asl users there are in this country,00:06:02.995,00:06:20.146
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_05_55.454-00_06_02.995.mp4,and if you get an acs survey you can mark down that you 're deaf,00:05:55.454,00:06:02.995
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_05_45.812-00_05_55.454.mp4,so if you have not filled out your u.s. census questionnaire you have two weeks to complete it,00:05:45.812,00:05:55.454
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_05_23.656-00_05_30.863.mp4,so it can be difficult to really look at how many signing deaf people there are in the u.s.,00:05:23.656,00:05:30.863
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_05_07.173-00_05_23.656.mp4,what this means is that acs data will inform us about how many people are deaf out there but it would n't be clear whether they use asl or not,00:05:07.173,00:05:23.656
fk1C9sC3uuw-00_04_49.055-00_05_07.173.mp4,the u.s. census said due to the way data are currently collected we are not able to provide separate data about asl use,00:04:49.055,00:05:07.173
lMW3aVp4fRw-00_00_23.699-00_00_28.679.mp4,and canadians are making sure that there is a deaf superintendent period,00:00:23.699,00:00:28.679

lMW3aVp4fRw-00_04_25.721-00_04_37.220.mp4,those universities have a wonderful asl bilingual philosophy they 've got research that proves l1 first language asl learners usually are successful with high literacy skills,00:04:25.721,00:04:37.220

NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_11_57.250-00_12_43.250.mp4,the courant also reported that the state legislature had a proposal to remove the statue of limitations for sexual assault survivors to bring lawsuits but that the judiciary committee tabled it did not advance the bill on friday a few hours before asd 's report,00:11:57.250,00:12:43.250
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_11_33.666-00_11_57.250.mp4,the courant reported that according to connecticut law many of the allegations are too old for the survivors to bring either a criminal or civil case,00:11:33.666,00:11:57.250

NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_18_02.790-00_18_14.083.mp4,i brought along research because the cool thing about these deaf doctors is they typically will do research on technology that is n't accessible like facemasks and they would make the masks themselves,00:18:02.790,00:18:14.083
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_14_56.791-00_15_00.750.mp4,i 'd be driving along and fingerspell the words until i felt confident,00:14:56.791,00:15:00.750
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_15_28.291-00_15_39.166.mp4,also your character used her voice to communicate and you wore those surgical masks that were transparent so you could lipread,00:15:28.291,00:15:39.166
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_17_29.875-00_17_43.125.mp4,so that 's how we ended up using the staff interpreter through skype because it turns out the grey 's anatomy already had a contract with skype so we ca n't use facetime,00:17:29.875,00:17:43.125
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_17_26.208-00_17_29.875.mp4,when it comes to tv production you just never have enough time,00:17:26.208,00:17:29.875
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_17_19.958-00_17_26.208.mp4,that works too because they did n't have to find an interpreter with the little time we had,00:17:19.958,00:17:26.208
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_17_10.125-00_17_19.958.mp4,however my research seemed to show that doctors typically they would n't release staff interpreters to fly out because the interpreters were being paid by their employing hospitals,00:17:10.125,00:17:19.958
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_17_04.415-00_17_10.125.mp4,because i feel that since dr. riley worked at ucsf she would have an interpreter there,00:17:04.415,00:17:10.125
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_17_01.625-00_17_04.415.mp4,it 's not vri but facetime,00:17:01.625,00:17:04.415
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_16_54.291-00_17_01.625.mp4,i thought why not have dr. riley call her staff interpreter on facetime,00:16:54.291,00:17:01.625
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_16_47.000-00_16_54.291.mp4,so i had to think of options and it looked like my character could choose to not sign at all or something else that i thought of,00:16:47.000,00:16:54.291
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_16_43.666-00_16_47.000.mp4,when it comes to producing tv shows you just do n't have the time,00:16:43.666,00:16:47.000
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_15_19.500-00_15_28.291.mp4,in the show your character dr. riley did use a vri video relay interpreter as a communication tool,00:15:19.500,00:15:28.291
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_16_34.707-00_16_39.791.mp4,she is a doctor who works with bodies and she connects with people so it was important for this character to use sign language,00:16:34.707,00:16:39.791
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_16_22.125-00_16_29.457.mp4,well consider that most of the characters that i took on would speak and lipread,00:16:22.125,00:16:29.457
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_16_15.875-00_16_22.125.mp4,so with the little time we had they asked me if i would speak and lipread,00:16:15.875,00:16:22.125
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_16_10.916-00_16_15.875.mp4,most of the deaf doctors they reached out would usually speak or lipread,00:16:10.916,00:16:15.875
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_16_09.500-00_16_10.916.mp4,i 'm happy they did that,00:16:09.500,00:16:10.916
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_16_04.707-00_16_09.500.mp4,they seemed to have interviewed most of the doctors and asked them questions on their own,00:16:04.707,00:16:09.500
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_15_56.416-00_16_04.707.mp4,i ended up getting a script just before the show maybe a week or less before we started filming so there was not a lot of time,00:15:56.416,00:16:04.707
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_15_54.000-00_15_56.416.mp4,it was maybe 3 months before the show was finalized,00:15:54.000,00:15:56.416
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_15_45.832-00_15_54.000.mp4,we researched a lot about deaf doctors and how they use these tools then we turned over the data to the show 's writers way in advance,00:15:45.832,00:15:54.000
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_15_39.166-00_15_45.832.mp4,could you explain the thought process between you and your team in deciding to use these tools,00:15:39.166,00:15:45.832
NJ-7WUtB5Xk-00_16_29.457-00_16_34.707.mp4,however for this particular situation i really wanted her to sign because i thought it suited this character very nicely,00:16:29.457,00:16:34.707
